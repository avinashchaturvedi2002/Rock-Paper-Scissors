## Rock Paper Scissors - A Javascript Mini-Project

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game built using Javascript. It's designed to provide hands-on experience with Javascript fundamentals.

### Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Play the game by clicking the Rock, Paper, or Scissors buttons!

### Functionality

The game prompts the user to choose between Rock, Paper, and Scissors. It then randomly generates a choice for the computer opponent. Based on the selections, the game determines the winner and displays the result on the screen.

### Learning Objectives

This project helps you practice:

* Capturing user input through buttons or forms.
* Using `if` statements and conditional logic to determine the winner.
* Utilizing the `Math.random()` function to generate random choices for the computer.
* Understanding basic Javascript syntax and structure.

### Feel free to:

* Modify the code to explore different functionalities.
* Experiment with adding difficulty levels or keeping score.
* This is a foundation to build more complex interactive games using Javascript.

**Enjoy playing and learning Javascript!**
